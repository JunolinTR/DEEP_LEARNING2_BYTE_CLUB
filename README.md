**Deep Learning 2**

blog generation project

In this project, I have generated blog content using given summaries by implementing advanced NLP techniques and deep learning models. The idea was to make a model that could convert one small summary into a detailed blog article, quite like how a writer would do: expand a simple outline into full-fledged content. Though essentially this work is an extension of an earlier project, it represents a completely independent research effort.

Drawing on the experience of creating the datasets of paragraphs and their headings by web scraping, I fine-tuned a language model to create headings based on content. Since the chosen project requires such a large amount of data to train on, for this project I used a Kaggle dataset of roughly 190k blog articles. This experience was really important for me, as it provided great insight into the creation of the dataset and fine-tuning of the model. Later on, I tried to put it into practice in the current project.

First of all, I needed to create an appropriate dataset of articles and their further summaries based on web scraping and extractive summarization. The tech stack included Python, NLTK, Gensim, and Pandas for data processing and TensorFlow for model training. This means the most important sentences in each article needed to be picked out for summarization, to accurately ensure capturing key points necessary for training the model on the expansion of summaries into full-length articles.
